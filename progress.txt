NOTE: if you change something, please update it in this file so we can all tell how far we have gotten.

For those of you wondering, this will be a C++ project, and must compile to c++98 standard. It will use
the libsocket library (included here) for all communications in linux, and will need a Windows library
written with EXACTLY the same API. It works like this (only include libsocket.h)
Classes:
	serverSocket: manages ports and allows the creation of clients
	connectedSocket: a direct socket connection to another system
	clientSocket: a class used to connect to an open serverSocket and create a connectedSocket

Methods:
	serverSocket:
		serverSoket(int portno): open a server on port portno
		connectedSocket * Accept(): fetch the next waiting client and return it as a connectedSocket
		Close(): destroy the server
	connectedSocket AND clientSocket:
		connectedSocket(int fd): open a socket with manual file descriptor
		ssize_t write(void *data, ssize_t size): write size bytes of data to stream and return number written
		ssize_t read(void *data, ssize_t size): read size bytes from stream to data and return number read
		Close(): destroy connection
You may look at the file spec.txt in order to determine how we will build this system. I would love it if somebody
would hop on and make the windows implementation of libsocket so that we can make this more cross platform.

Added data_types.cpp and data_types.h so that the types all match up with the spec
